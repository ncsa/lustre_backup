61 bw.bkup                 Adjust kernel shared memory parameters in         H
                           install_backup.sh script.

64 bw.bkup                 How to track dar memory usage throughout
                           process execution?
                             3/17/2014 Perhaps monitor process every
                           1 or 2 seconds and keep track of max
                           used.
70 bw.bkup                 lustre_backup_service rmlogs action
                           should not remove current log file, just
                           old logs that have a date suffix
58 bw.bkup                 Add end _date in backup_info file.        DELETE
                             2/17/2014 Do this in backup cleanup
                           phase.
 6 bw.bkup                 Make dar.py Luster aware to retain lustre ER
                           stripe info
                             12/11/2012 Can this be added to the
                           catalog XML file?
                             2/12/2013 Could this use lustre-aware
                           tar?
 7 bw.bkup                 Perform differential backups, instead of  ER
                           incremental, until size is large enough
                           to justify a new full.
                             2/12/2013 See also notes about using
                           retention policy to determine frequency
                           of full backups.
19 bw.bkup                 Retention policy - adjustable for each    ER
                           topdir
                             2/12/2013 Perhaps even allow
                           customizable for specific subdirs (
                           otherwise use default of parent topdir).
20 bw.bkup                 Use value of retention policy to          ER
                           calculate frequency of full backups.
                             2/12/2013 Idea is to do fewer fulls for
                           dirs with longer retention policy.
55 bw.bkup                 Fix mk_archive_elapsed_seconds            V1      H
                           calculation to use output file last mod
                           time, resulting in better accuracy.

                           calculation to use output file last mod

                           are started?
15 bw.bkup                 Should all 'status types' go into a       V1      L
                           single file
62 bw.bkup                 Add on-fly catalogue isolation to remove  V2
                           separate step of catalogue isolation.
                             3/4/2014 See on-fly-isolate option
63 bw.bkup                 Add better tracking to DAR module.        V2
                             3/14/2014 Use start _time and file last
                           mtime to calculate an accurate elapsed
                           time for both archive and catalog
                           operations.
                             3/14/2014 Use dar to generate a summary
                           of the operation and save it to the
                           infofile.
66 bw.bkup                 Add support for filelist to dar backup    V2

                             5/23/2014 By setting dar slice size to
                           32G, no need for lustre striping.

21 bw.bkup.CmdInjection    Add ability to pause mgmt process.
                             2/13/2013 Most likely can/should be
                           included with control injection.
 9 bw.bkup.CmdInjection    Support for commands to be sent to the    V2
                           running manager.
                             12/11/2012 Could be used for getting
                           live status , read config file on the

31 bw.bkup.Design          Convert serviceprovider to module.
60 bw.bkup.Design          Add support to lustre_backup_service to

                           lustre_backup.cfg to use references to

                             10/10/2013 Should this be in
                           backup_dir.py instead?
                             10/10/2013 dar.py will know how to
                           analyze a single dar backup for success
                           or failure reason.
                             10/10/2013 backup_dir will call

                             10/30/2013 Keep downHosts list. Needed
                           to scale to a large number of hosts.
                             10/30/2013 Hosts that are down get
                           added to downHosts list. Check these
                           every semiDayEvent.
                             10/30/2013 Available hosts get added to
                           availHosts list. When a job is scheduled
                           on a host, that host moves to end of
                           availHosts list.
                             10/30/2013 If a host on availHosts list
                           does not haveJobSlot, then put on
                           busyHosts list.
                             10/30/2013 When a

                           move host from busyHosts list to
                           availHosts list ( allowing that host
                           might not be on busyHosts list, which
                           might be the case if host can run more
                           than one job and was full at a point in
                           time.)
                             10/30/2013 Check busyHosts list each
                           semiDayEvent for nodes that can move to
                           availHosts ( or downHosts) list. This is
                           needed for the cases of ( remote host
                           restarts, mgr restarts and a remote host
                           is still full).

                             2/12/2013 RemoteHost will accept

                             2/12/2013 Maybe add a counter to
                           LustreBackupService and a method to query

                           updated/replaced on a remote host for a
                           job already started?
