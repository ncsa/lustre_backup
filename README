11 bw-bkup    Implement incremental backup                                   H
                11/15/2012 Ready to test incremental backup.
17 bw-bkup    Create stub for TransferBackup and CleanupBackup so that       H
              incrementals can be tested.
 6 bw-bkup    Implement backup transfer                                      M
32 bw-bkup    Add support for per-host ip:port                               M
34 bw-bkup    Implement globus online wrapper                                M
 7 bw-bkup    Implement CleanupSuccessfulBackupEvent                         L
 8 bw-bkup    Implement scan_for_errors                                      L
10 bw-bkup    Test backup recovery                                           L
                11/8/2012 Recovered from 'dar started' state.
16 bw-bkup    Add config settings for StartOfDay StartOfHour                 L
                12/11/2012 Number of seconds between generating each
              type of event.

15 bw-bkup    jobmanager - check down hosts
                11/26/2012 Added code. Need to test
19 bw-bkup    Ticker should use value of incremental_frequency to
              trigger startOfDayEvent
20 bw-bkup    Add config value to control frequency of checking for
              down hosts and problem backups

ENHANCEMENTS:
25 bw-bkup-er use list of files for incremental backup

28 bw-bkup-er Get list of changed files from robinhood
29 bw-bkup-er Perform differential backups, instead of incremental,
              until size is large enough to justify a new full.
30 bw-bkup-er Add Python native logging.
31 bw-bkup-er Support for multi-file dar archives.
36 bw-bkup-er Support for partial dar recovery.
                12/11/2012 If a full was interrupted, but exited
              cleanly, do an incremental then merge for a complete full

                12/11/2012 Could be used for getting live status , re
